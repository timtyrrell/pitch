pitch feedback:

Please break it down into helper functions, there's so much going on there it, you might have a need for a whole object to replace that method
I didn't read it though
play_game really ought to be bin/pitch
and then it should instantiate something like a Pitch::Application
and just call run() on it
and then proper functions should be in place for everything that's in this big mess
it's easier for me to give extensions on projects than it is on assignments
so since we're down to the wire, try to get your assignments sewed up
I'll be around throughout the day tomorrow
yeah, but again, we've gone over this many times in RMU
the emphasis is on building something smaller than you anticipated if needed, but building it well
so the refactoring needs to be done before you can get credit
yes, but it should have been your focus on your project, too
Anyway, just do the best you can with the time you have left
