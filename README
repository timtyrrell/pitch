Why? - My fraternity in college basically played one card game, "pitch", with a variation of the rules listed above. I have been meaning (for the past 10 years) to write an online card game so that my old college friends and I could continue playing, even though we now live apart.

Game Rules: It is a 4 player game, with partners sitting across from each other. One person shuffles and deals 6 total cards to each player by making 2 passes around the table. The person to the left of the dealer bids from 2 to 5, or passes on a bid. Others can bid higher as it cycles back to the dealer who can bid higher or pass. High trump is a point, low trump is a point, trump jack and off trump jack are each points, and total count of cards with point values is the 5th point. You only play one card per each of the 6 games for a "hand". You must follow suit. You do not need to start the game with a trump card. These are calculated after the 6 hands are played but before a reshuffle and re-deal, obviously the person to the left deals next. If the team that bids does not get at least the number they bid for that game, they get "set" and lose the number they bid. First team to 15 wins.
